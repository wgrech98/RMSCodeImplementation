##Background & Objectives
This 

##Dataset
The dataset is composed of the characteristics related to the choice of a SDLC methodology. Overall, the dataset  amounted to 143 records.

##Models
The repository hosts three python algorithms, namely the KNN algorithm, the decision tree algorithm, and the CN2 algorithm. 

#CN2 Algorithm 
The CN2 algorithm is a rule-based technique that supersedes its predecessors, namely the ID3 algorithm, and AQ by accounting for the presence of noise in the domain data.

A rule list produced with the CN2 algorithm follows the following notation:

if Condition_1 then Class_A
else if Condition_2 then Class_B
...
else Default_Class.

#KNN Algorithm 
In KNN, the trained data is compared with test data and distances are calculated using Euclidean distance. It then classifies an instance by finding its nearest neighbors and recommend the top n nearest neighbor SDLC Methodologies. The algorithm runs as follows:

#Decision Tree Algorithm 
Decision Trees (DTs) are another important rule-based technique represented portrayed as a tree structure. The algorithm splits the dataset into smaller classes according to the most important predictor in the predictor space with an if-then rule set. When running the decision tree algorithm,
